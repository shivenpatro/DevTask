# PopX UI Clone - ReactJS Task

This project is a ReactJS implementation of a user interface design, developed as a qualifier task for a React JS Internship/Fresher role. The goal was to accurately replicate the provided Adobe XD design, ensuring pixel-perfection, seamless navigation, and a clean codebase.

## Design

The application faithfully recreates the UI from the following Adobe XD design:

## Features Implemented

The application consists of four main pages with navigation between them:

1.  **Welcome Page:** Landing page with options to create an account or log in.
2.  **Login Page:** User authentication form.
3.  **Create Account Page:** User registration form with various input fields and options.
4.  **Account Settings Page:** Displays user profile information (placeholder content).

Key focuses during development included:
*   Pixel-perfect UI replication from the design.
*   Centering the mobile app interface on the webpage.
*   Smooth and functional navigation between pages using React Router.
*   Clean, well-formatted, and maintainable ReactJS code.

## Technologies Used

*   **React JS:** Core library for building the user interface.
*   **Vite:** Frontend tooling for a fast development experience.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Programming language.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the application, with a focus on detailed replication of the design.
*   **React Router DOM:** For handling client-side routing and navigation.

## Running the Project Locally

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shivenpatro/DevTask.git
    cd DevTask 
    ```
    (If you cloned into a different folder name, `cd` into that, or if you are already in `popx-app`, skip cloning and just `cd popx-app` if you are one level up)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory (if not already there):**
    ```bash
    cd popx-app 
    ```
    (This step assumes the React project is inside a `popx-app` folder within the `DevTask` repository. If `popx-app` is the root of the repository, then just `cd DevTask` or the repo name is enough).
    *Based on our setup, the React project is `popx-app`, which is likely the root of what was pushed.*

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
